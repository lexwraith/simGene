# simGene
A project for a Computational Biology class; Simulates DNA sequencing reads and detects Copy Number Variations

1. Confirm Ref and Alternate sequences are different
2. Create two error-free sequences from ref and alternate with 25bp (subject to change)
3. Create random sampler that works in fetal fraction distribution
