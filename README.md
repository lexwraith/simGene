# simGene
A project for a Computational Biology class; Simulates DNA sequencing reads and detects Copy Number Variations

1. Confirm Ref and Alternate sequences are different
2. Create two error-free sequences from ref and alternate with 25bp (subject to change)
3. Create random sampler that works in fetal fraction distribution

End Goals:
Read Generator - Creates a new random bucket of reads with arguments <genome sequence> and <coverage>.
    Note that this is error-free by default. The entire point of this is to create a super data set
    so that we can sample from it for our real data set (in other words, after Read Sampler is used,
    none of the data generated by Read Generator should be used for the simulation).

    In a sense, we're using this as a de novo reconstruction of the entire genome for a baby, and
    the ReadSampler's purpose is to actually simulate the reads we would have gotten from maternal
    plasma.

Read Sampler - From a read bucket (produced by Read Generator) create ANOTHER read bucket that represents
    a real set of reads in a real-world setting. It needs to generate several random variables:
    1. Fetal Fraction (~N(.35,.1))
    2. Some form of Trisomy22 (partial, long deletion, etc.)
    3. The actual reads that are sampled from the output of Read Generator
    4. Average coverage (multiply our reads in a given window by this constant to get average)

HMM - End goal that takes in a set of reads and produces a HMM that can be used against training data 
    (in this case the output of ReadSampler) and can use Forward-Backward Algorithm to determine the
    state at a given position.
